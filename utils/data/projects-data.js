        "description": "Developed a climate temperature forecasting system using SARIMA and Prophet models. The system was trained on historical climate data to predict future temperature variations with high precision. Data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and time series analysis were applied to enhance predictive accuracy. The final model provided insights into climate trends and temperature fluctuations for different seasons.",
